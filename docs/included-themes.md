**Notes**

Tips from the theme developer about the scrolling background:

> You can still use pretty much any image you want, but for best results make sure yours is: 
> 
> - Horizontally tileable
> - Wide and short 
> - About 1500px wide
> - Fades to a solid color either at the top of bottom (which is used to fill the empty space above or below your image).
> - The example image is [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschroeder/11876741703)
